        <h1><center>ALUVA</center></h1>
        <P class="p">
            Aluva (IPA: [ɐːluʋɐ]; also known by its former name Alwaye) is a region in the city of Kochi in Kerala, India. It is also a part of the Kochi metropolitan area and is situated around 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city center on the banks of Periyar River.[1] A major transportation hub, with easy access to all major forms of transportation, Aluva acts as a corridor which links the highland districts to the rest of Kerala. Cochin International Airport at Nedumbassery is 11.7 km from Aluva. Aluva is accessible through rail (Aluva railway station), air (Cochin International Airport), metro (Kochi Metro) along with major highways and roadlines. Aluva KSRTC bus station is an important transport hub in Kerala and one of the busiest stations in central part of the state.

Aluva, home to the summer residency of the Travancore royal family – the Alwaye Palace -[2] is also famous for the Sivarathri festival celebrated annually at the sandbanks of Periyar. The Advaita Ashrams in Aluva founded in 1913 by Sree Narayana Guru, one of India's greatest social reformers, adds to the cultural significance of the region.[3] Today, despite being a part of the city as well as the Kochi urban agglomeration, Aluva is still only an autonomous municipality with its civic administration conducted by Aluva Municipal Council, primarily because Kochi Corporation has not expanded its limits for over 53 years. Aluva also serves as the administrative centre of the Aluva taluk. Villages from Mukundapuram, Kanayannur, Kunathunad and North Paravur taluks were combined to form Aluva Taluk in 1956.The headquarters of the District Police Chief of Ernakulam Rural Police District, Superintending engineer, PWD (Roads) and of the District Educational Officer, Aluva are also located there. It is the northern starting point of Kochi Metro rail's first phase which began its operations in June 2017, as well as Kochi city bus network. The Metro station is at Bypass, Aluva
